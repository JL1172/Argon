5. Access Modifiers (always start)

- **pub (short for public, exposed globally)**
  - classes : pub exposes globally
  - methods : pub exposes globally as far as the class is exposed
    - ex: if class isnt public and then you prefix a method with public it doesnt do anything globally because of heirarchy
  - variables : pub exposes it globally, not suggested because of encapsulation
    - pub also only exposes it as far as the class is exposed
    - when initialized in a method, the variables are block scoped so you can not expose them outside the method so pub reserved dont do anything
    - if public exposed globally (not suggested) if the class is public

 - **reserved (also like private)**
   - classes : if a class is reserved, it is not accessible to any other class in the package, so only can be used by other's in the class
   - methods : if a method is reserved, it cannot be used outside of the class 
   - variables: if reserved it cannot be called outside of the class

- **prot (protected)**
  - classes: not relevant to classes
  - methods: not relevant to methods
  - variables: makes an element readonly

- **default (not prefixed)**
  - classes: package private
  - methods: package private
  - variables: only visible to that file

6. Keywords

- **const (immutable)**
  - classes : not relevant to classes (maybe in the future to essentially not allow them to be subclasses but i am not doing any of that right now)
  - method : not relevant to methods (same as classes)
  - variables: that variable is now immutable (might add immutability to what the pointers are pointing at as well, i.e objects)

- **stat (same as static)**
  - classes: if a class is static it only makes sense if it is a nested class
  - method: not accessible through instance of class, but through calling the class itself
  - variables: not accessible through instance of class, but through calling the class itself

- **cls (word for class)**
