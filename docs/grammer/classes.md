# Documentation For Class Declaration

## Class Declaration 

- Classes are declared with `cls` keyword
- Classes that have no access modifiers are package private

## Class Rules

### Nested Classes

- Classes can be nested
- Classes nested can be given access modifiers such as `reserved`
- If nested class is public, but parent class is not, this will have no effect and will throw a `compilation error`
